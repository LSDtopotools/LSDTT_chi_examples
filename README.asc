= LSDTopoTools example datasets for the chi mapping tool

This repository contains example datasets for the *chi mapping tool*.

The datasets are in https://www.harrisgeospatial.com/docs/ENVIImageFiles.html[ENVI bil format]. All data is projected into http://www.dmap.co.uk/utmworld.htm[UTM] coordinates. All datasets are derived from http://www.opentopography.org/[opentopography] SRTM datasets.

== Note on converting data from opentopography.org

Opentopography is a fantastic place to get seamless [SRTM] data. Once you pick a location for download, you need to unzip it. This can be done using:

[source, console]
----
$ tar -xvzf rasters_srtm.tar.gz
----

and then converting the resulting raster using gdalwarp:

[source, console]
----
$ gdalwarp -t_srs '+proj=utm +zone=49 +datum=WGS84' -of ENVI -tr 30 30 -r cubic output_srtm.tif Xian.bil
----

You will need to change the UTM zone as well as the name of the output. You can change the `-tr` flag depending on the resolution of the DEM (e.g., `-tr 30 30` for 30m data, `-tr 90 90` for 90m data). *DO NOT* forget the `-r cubic` flag or else you will get a striped DEM.

| Xian.bil, Xian.hdr
| The raster of the Xi'an site. It actually the range that contains https://www.google.co.uk/maps/search/Huashan+mountain,+China/@34.5080992,109.774593,9z[Huashan Mountain]. It is in http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84-utm-zone-49n/[UTM zone 49], at 30m resolution. Source is SRTM from http://www.opentopography.org/[opentopography].
